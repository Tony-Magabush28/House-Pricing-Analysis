# 🏡 House Price Prediction and Analysis

This project uses Python to predict house prices using different regression techniques (linear, polynomial, and multiple regression). It also includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) using measures such as mean, median, mode, percentiles, and standard deviation.

## 🚀 What I Did
- Explored the data: calculated mean, median, mode, percentiles, and standard deviation.
- Visualized data distributions using histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.
- Built models using linear, polynomial, and multiple regression.
- Evaluated models using R² score.

## 📈 Results

- The best model achieved an R² score of **0.78**.
