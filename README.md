# 🏡 House Price Prediction and Analysis

This project uses Python to predict house prices using various regression techniques, including linear, polynomial, and multiple regression. It also includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), which involves measures such as the mean, median, mode, percentiles, and standard deviation.

## 🚀 What I Learned
- Explored the data by calculating mean, median, mode, percentiles, and standard deviation.
- Visualized data distributions using histograms, box plots, and scatter plots. 
- Built regression models using linear, polynomial, and multiple regression techniques.
- Evaluated models using R² score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
